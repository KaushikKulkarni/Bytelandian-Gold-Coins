###The Problem Statement is as follows :
***
In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.
Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n
can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4.
But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).
You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange
rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.
You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars
you can get for it?<br>
<b>Input</b>

The input will contain several test cases (not more than 10). Each
testcase is a single line with a number n, 0 <= n <= 1 000 000 000.
It is the number written on your coin.<br>
<b>Output</b>

For each test case output a single line, containing the maximum amount
of American dollars you can make.<br>
<b>Example</b>

<b>Input:</b><br>

<b>Output:</b><br>
